### **1. JavaScript ES6 Destructuring:**

Destructuring is a simple way to take out multiple pieces of information from objects and arrays. 
It was added in ES6 and helps make your code shorter and easier to understand.

## **Array Destructuring**

Array destructuring lets you take values from an array and put them into separate variables.

## **Object Destructuring**

Object destructuring lets you take properties from an object and put them into separate variables. This makes your code shorter and easier to read.

### **2. JavaScript ES6 Arrow Functions:**

Arrow functions are a new way to write functions in JavaScript, introduced in ES6. They provide a more concise syntax compared to traditional function expressions and have some unique behaviors.


### **3. JavaScript ES6 Spread and Rest Operators:**

The spread and rest operators are represented by three dots (`...`) and were introduced in ES6. They are powerful tools that make working with arrays and objects more flexible and concise.

### **Spread Operator**

The spread operator allows you to expand elements of an iterable (like an array) into individual elements. It's useful for combining arrays, adding elements to an array, or spreading elements into function arguments.


### **Rest Operator**

The rest operator allows you to represent an indefinite number of arguments as an array. It is useful for functions that accept a variable number of arguments or for collecting the remaining elements of an array or object.
