# October-Daily-Coding-Challenges
Daily coding challenges for October 2024. This repository contains solutions to coding challenges solved each day to improve problem-solving skills and consistency. Challenges are sourced from platforms like LeetCode and HackerRank, covering topics such as algorithms, data structures, and system design.

Welcome to the **October Daily Coding Challenges** repository! This repository contains my solutions to daily coding challenges for the month of October 2024. The goal of this project is to improve problem-solving skills, algorithmic thinking, and consistency by committing solutions to GitHub every day.

## Overview

- **Start Date:** October 20, 2024
- **End Date:** October 31, 2024
- **Platforms Used:** LeetCode, HackerRank
- **Focus Areas:**
  - Algorithms (Sorting, Searching, etc.)
  - Data Structures (Arrays, Strings, Trees, Graphs, etc.)
  - Dynamic Programming
  - Recursion & Backtracking
  - System Design & Optimization

## Daily Structure

Each day, I will:
1. Solve one or more coding challenges (easy to medium difficulty).
2. Commit the solution(s) to this repository.
3. Include comments explaining the approach and thought process behind the solution.

## Directory Structure

The repository is structured as follows:

/October-Daily-Coding-Challenges ├── Day One 20/10/24 │ ├── problem-1.md # Description of the first LeetCode problem for the day │ ├── solution-1.py # Solution to the first problem (can be in any language) │ ├── problem-2.md # Description of the second LeetCode problem for the day (if applicable) │ ├── solution-2.py # Solution to the second problem │ ├── notes.md # Notes and explanation of the day's approach and learnings ├── Day Two 21/10/24 │ ├── problem-1.md │ ├── solution-1.py │ ├── notes.md └── README.md


## Progress

- **Day One 20/10/24:** Solved 2-3 problems on arrays and strings.
- **Day Two 21/10/24:** Focused on data structures, particularly stacks and queues.

## Goals

- Improve problem-solving skills by practicing daily.
- Strengthen understanding of core algorithms and data structures.
- Commit daily to maintain consistency and document progress.
